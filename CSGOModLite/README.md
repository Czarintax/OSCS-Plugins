# CSGOMod Lite (ReAPI Fork)

A heavily modified and optimized lightweight **ReAPI fork** of [CSGOMod](https://github.com/TheDoctor0), originally developed by [TheDoctor0](https://github.com/TheDoctor0).

This fork has been **simplified** to remove all additional resources such as models, maps, and sounds, while retaining functionality **exclusively for the rank system**.  
It still includes **sprites for rank badges** (used for hovering).  

Originally developed for my own server, **OLD SCHOOL CS** (running on the Xash3D engine), this version is now shared publicly following the serverâ€™s closure.
